                           Release Notes for
                P4PHP, Perforce's script API for PHP

                            Version 2020.2

Introduction

    This document contains release notes for P4PHP.

    Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, e.g. 2009.2/234567.
    YYYY is the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCCC is the
    bug fix change level.  Each bug fix in these release notes is
    marked by its change number.  Any build includes (1) all bug fixes
    of all previous releases and (2) all bug fixes of the current
    release up to the bug fix change level.

    To determine the version of your P4PHP, run the following command:

    php --ri perforce

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unix and Mac: Building the P4PHP Extension

    To build P4PHP, you need the header files and libraries used by
    PHP and the "phpize" command-line utility. Both of these
    requirements can be met by installing PHP from source or by
    installing the development php packages (php-devel) appropriate
    for your operating system.

    After you have obtained the required files and the phpize utility,
    perform the following steps:

    1. Download the Perforce P4PHP files.
       ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r20.2/bin.tools/p4php.tgz
       for the 2020.2 P4PHP.

    2. Download the Perforce C++ API from the Perforce FTP site at
       "ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce". The API archive is located
       in release and platform-specific subdirectories, choose one
       matching OpenSSL version available at target system and the
       C library, for example p4api-glibc2.12-openssl1.1.1.tgz.

       Note: 32-bit builds of P4PHP require a 32-bit version of the
             C++ API and a 32-bit version of PHP. 64-bit builds of
             P4PHP require a 64-bit version of the C++ API and a
             64-bit version of PHP.

    3. Extract both archives into an empty directory.

    4. To build P4PHP, change to the p4php-<version> directory, and run
       the following commands:

           phpize

           ./configure --with-perforce=<path to Perforce C++ API>

           make

    5. To test your P4PHP build, run the following command:

           make test

       Note: the test harness requires a copy of the Perforce server
             executable, p4d, be installed in the current working
             directory.

    6. To install P4PHP, run the following command:

           make install

       Note: the installation typically needs to be performed as
             the root user.

    7. To enable P4PHP, edit your "php.ini" file and add the following
       line:

           extension=perforce.so;

       Note: to locate your "php.ini" file, run the following command:

             php --ini

       Now run:

             php -m

       to confirm that the P4PHP module is being loaded.

    8. To verify that P4PHP works, run the following command:

           php --ri perforce

       If the extension is correctly installed, P4PHP displays
       its version information.

    SSL support
    -----------

    Perforce Server 2020.2 supports SSL connections and the C++ API has
    been compiled with this support. This means that in order to build
    P4PHP, the underlying PHP framework must include OpenSSL.

Testing P4PHP

    You can use the following small script to test P4PHP.  Place it
    into a file named "p4php_info.php":

    <?php
    $p4 = new P4();
    print_r($p4->identify());
    $p4->port = '<server>:<port>';
    $p4->user = '<user>';
    $p4->connect();
    print_r($p4->run('info'));
    $p4->disconnect();
    ?>

    Note: substitute <server> for the fully qualified server name,
          <port> for the port p4d/p4s is running on, and <user> for a
          valid Perforce user.

    To execute the test script, run the following command:

        php -f p4php_info.php

    If it succeeds, you should see output like this:

        > php -f p4php_info.php

Compatibility Statements

    Server Compatibility

        You can use any release of P4PHP with any release of the
        Perforce server later than 2001.1

    API Compatibility

        The 2020.2 release of P4PHP requires the 2020.2 Perforce API.
        Older releases will not work and will fail to compile.

    OpenSSL compatibility

        The minimum version of OpenSSL libraries required is driven
        by the 2020.2 server; the minimum version needed is 1.0.2.

    PHP compatibility

        The 2020.2 release of P4PHP is compatible with PHP versions: 7.2.x - 8.0.x

    Platform compatibility

        Though P4PHP is generally portable, this release is certified
        only on the following platforms:

            Linux 2.6 Intel (x86, x86_64)
            Windows 10, 2016, 2019

    Compiler compatibility

        To build P4PHP from source, you must use a version of PHP that
        has been compiled with the same compiler used to build the
        Perforce C++ API. For most platforms, use gcc/g++.

        Attempting to use a different compiler or a different version
        of the compiler causes linker errors due to differences in name
        handling.

        Correctly set the program version if specified.

Bugs fixed in 2013.1

    #597731 (Job #63968) *
        Fixed memory leak in the output handler code.  The memory leak
        was particularly noticeable when using output handlers with large
        files.

    #567338 (Job #62248)
        Test 013 'Identity' will now work correctly on Windows.

    #541820, #541832 (Job #60875) *

    #541502 (Job #60865) *
        Fixed a problem that caused a runtime error when running on
        Ubuntu 12.10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2012.1

    #408393 (Job #51084) * ** ***
        Added support for SSL connections to SSL-enabled servers. No
        build changes are needed to include SSL support, as PHP itself
        is dynamically linked against OpenSSL libraries.

        The identify() method will then report the version of the OpenSSL
        library used for building the Perforce C++ API (not the version
        PHP is dynamically linked against).

    #Note:
        Although the 2012.1 server now supports action-resolve, P4PHP
        does not include support for this at this time.

Bugs fixed since 2012.1/442152

    #469976, #469763 (Jobs #55524, #56332) *
        Fixed a problem where the run_filelog() method could emit
        warnings and/or fail to populate revision objects correctly
        under some conditions.

Bugs fixed in 2012.1

    #439393 (Job #54125) *
        Setting the 'prog' property of the P4 class now actually takes
        effect.

    #429067 (Job #51901) *
        Updated the stored spec templates to match the 2012.1 server
        specs. This ensures new features are present in specs which are
        accessed offline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2011.1

    #339007 (Job #42252) * **
        P4PHP supports a callback interface by providing a P4.handler
        property. Set P4.handler to an instance of a
        P4_OutputHandlerInterface implementor to enable callbacks. When
        a handler is defined, P4PHP will invoke the handler for every
        response it receives from the Perforce Server immediately instead
        of collecting all results together in an array first. This can be
        used to make applications more scalable and more responsive if
        large results are expected.
        See the documentation for details on the Output Handler.

    #332692 (Job #45863) * ** ***
        Enable streams in P4PHP by default. With this change, streams
        specific specs such as streams depots are listed. To disable the
        listing of streams specific specs either set the api_level to a
        value below 70 or disable stream handling by explicitly setting
        the P4.streams property to false.

Bugs fixed in 2011.1

    #424881 (Jobs #42375, #51886, #51917) *
        Fixed issues where p4 filelog could produce an erroneous result
        or cause a segmentation fault to occur.

    #385159 (Job #49324) **
        On Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 2008, a client running
        as Administrator would fail to properly process file names in
        non-ASCII character sets (such as Shift-JIS).

    #359248 (Job #48691) *
        Fixed a dangling pointer issue that caused memory segmentation
        faults when P4PHP was run on Windows platforms.

    #359180 (Job #49040) *
        Minor adjustments done to make P4PHP run properly on Mac OS X
        Lion.

    #342679 (Job #47726) *
        Fixed a bug where P4PHP would not compile on Windows platforms
        due to the tsrm_ls variable not being present.

    #339053 (Job #47423) *
        Made command arguments and the input property support binary
        values which contain null bytes.

    #308036, #337730 (Jobs #44695, #47235) *
        Adjusted the version string to be consistent with other APIs.
        Added API patch level and made OS names consistent.

    #333583 (Job #45521) *
        Fixed a bug where P4PHP would erroneously convert custom spec
        fields which ended in a digit into an array. They are now passed
        through unchanged.

    #332681 (Job #47529) *
        Updated the stored spec templates to match the 2011.1 server
        specs. This ensures new features such as streams are present in
        specs which are accessed offline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2010.2

    #262640 (Job #39740) * ** ***
        New methods 'GetStreams' and 'SetStreams' have been added to enable
        Streams support.

Bugs fixed in 2010.2

    #289739 (Job #43685) *
        Fixed a bug where P4PHP could segfault when attempting to use the
        'P4' instance during the late stages of a PHP process shutdown
        (via object destructors), where the instance being referenced may
        no longer be present in the zend_object_store. We guard against
        this scenario and emit a fatal zend_error.

    #273229 (Job #41378) *
        Fixed a pointer management bug that was causing crashes under
        Windows 64-bit.

    #264526 (Jobs #38248, #38488, #39008, #39471) *
        P4PHP now properly picks up the version string set in config.w32
        when compiled on a Windows platform.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality in 2010.1

    #238024 (Job #38089) *
        A new property, 'expand_sequences' enables scripts to control
        whether keys with trailing numbers are expanded into arrays
        in tagged output. By default, 'expand_sequences' is true to
        maintain backwards compatibility. Note that expansion can be
        enabled and disabled on a per-command basis.

Bugs fixed in 2010.1

    #238014 (Job #38084) *
        Tagged output with numeric sequences (e.g. foo0, foo1, ...)
        could conflict with tags that are not numbered (e.g. foo).
        This could cause P4PHP to crash. This change detects the
        conflict and skips expansion.

    #237983 (Job #38074) *
        Text output could be truncated if it contained null characters.
        This change makes handling of text output binary-safe.
